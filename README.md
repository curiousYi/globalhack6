# Globalhack 6 App

### What is it?

At Global Hack 6, a weekend hackathon, we were tasked with the goal of "hacking homelessness" in the city of St. Louis, Missouri. Our team decided to focus on building a solution that was geared towards prevention of homelessness because we believe that is the most effective way to do more with less. One common reason the homeless are not able to find employment is due a lack of documentation/identification such as a driver's license or a social security card, which many of us take for granted. However, even for the educated, navigating this process can be laborious and filling out the necessary forms can be especially tedious. Our application allows case workers at homelessness centers to determine which forms a person seeking jobs may need, as well as pre-fill  these forms using existing data in their database. In addition, we built a central job database that renders on Google Maps so that multiple centers can coordinate job assistance more efficiently.
